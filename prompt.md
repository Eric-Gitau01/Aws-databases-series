You're a senior full-stack engineer helping me build a local-first finance tracker called **VeeTracker** for small informal traders.

The app should work entirely in the browser using localStorage — no backend.

Build it using React and Tailwind CSS.

Features:
1. Local Auth System (fake signup/login) – store user sessions in localStorage
2. Add Transactions: income/expense, amount, category, method (manual, voice, photo), notes
3. Voice Input using Web Speech API for quick note-taking
4. Photo Input with OCR via [OCR.space](https://ocr.space/OCRAPI)
5. Dashboard: Show totals (income, expenses, profit), transaction list, and filters
6. Modular file structure with components:
   - AuthPage.jsx
   - Dashboard.jsx
   - TransactionForm.jsx
   - TransactionList.jsx
   - useLocalStorage.js
7. Use Tailwind for a clean UI, mobile responsive
8. Don’t explain anything, just generate the full working code

Project name: **VeeTracker**

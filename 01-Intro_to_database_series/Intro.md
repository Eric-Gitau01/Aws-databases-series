## I'm building database solutions on AWS

In this AWS Databases series, I'm learning about how to design, deploy, and manage cloud databases using AWS services like Aurora and DynamoDB. By the end of these projects, I will have hands-on experience connecting applications to databases, loading and querying data, and optimizing database performance in the cloud.

I'm learning about cloud databases because they are the backbone of scalable, secure, and cost-efficient applications, and mastering them is essential for building modern cloud solutions.

## Excited to share my progress - explore AWS databases with me!

I will set aside dedicated time each day to work on these database projects, ensuring consistent progress. I will keep myself accountable by tracking my tasks, setting milestones, and reviewing my progress regularly. My reward for completing this AWS Databases series will be gaining practical cloud database skills that I can showcase in my portfolio and use to advance my career in cloud engineering.

### What are databases?

Databases are organized systems for storing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently.
Cloud engineers use databases to build applications that can handle large amounts of information reliably, scale seamlessly with demand, and ensure data is secure and accessible from anywhere in the world. By leveraging cloud databases, engineers can focus on developing features and services without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

### What do database professionals do?

Database professionals are responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining databases to ensure data is accurate, secure, and easily accessible. They also optimize database performance, troubleshoot issues, and support applications that rely on data. 
The most interesting part of their job is solving complex data challenges, ensuring high availability at scale, and enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions.
